# F21GA - 3D Graphics and Animation

## The idea

The theme I chose for this assignment could be defined as "Twisted Beauty and the Beast". It wasn't motivated by the 3D graphics assignment at first. It came from a design I already planned to create. The design of the rose is to be used as a reference for a tattoo artist. I had the idea a while ago thinking about my next tattoo.  
The flower symbolises blooming. It's about growing up and becoming yourself. The fluid oozing out shows how this process can be weird and have unexpected results.
The goal was to have this contrast between something familiar and unsettling without losing beauty. It shows that weird and familiar can coexist in making something beautiful.

This wouldn't fit the rules of the assignment however. The assignment is oriented towards creating materials for a tv show intro. By adding a glass bell and some scenery, I made my initial design into a twisted version of *Beauty and the Beast*'s magical rose. I imagined how the rose would evolve if the Beast chose to stay this way, didn't care to look for love's true kiss and didn't change. The curse would be twisted in its purpose. The Beast would slowly corrupt it by exploiting his new terrifying strength. That corruption would manifest in the fluid slowly coming out of the flower.

The theme I chose was efficient. Everyone I showed the render poster and/or the video immediately recognised the classic tale. Most of them also got the feeling of uneasiness and disgust from the fluid that I was going for. I think the design adapted well to the assignment.
